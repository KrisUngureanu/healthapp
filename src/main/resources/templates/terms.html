    <h2>1. Service Description</h2>
    <p>HealthApp is a closed platform for elite sports medical teams. Team physicians (“Physician”) invite athletes (“Athlete”) to share data collected via integrations with <strong>Oura, Polar, Garmin, and WHOOP</strong> (“Integrations”). The Service aggregates metrics (e.g., sleep, HR/HRV, SpO₂, activity, workouts) and visualizes them for assigned Physicians to support training and recovery decisions.</p>
    <p><strong>Medical Disclaimer.</strong> The Service is <em>not</em> a medical device, does not diagnose conditions, and does not replace a medical consultation. All health decisions remain the responsibility of Physicians and Athletes.</p>

    <h2>2. Roles & Access</h2>
